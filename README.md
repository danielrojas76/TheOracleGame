# The-Oracle:-The-Great-Trial-v0.1

Answer the questions, kill the BOSS!

Creating this game is helping me improve my ability to name variables, maintain clean code, and navigate through a large amount of code using BREAD.

While I develop this game, I am taking a Full Stack Development course at Digital House, so I will be updating the game according to the content they teach me in the course. 

Features included in the game:

- Creation and storage of questions.
- Registration of the player's name at the beginning of the game.
